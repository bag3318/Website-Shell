### For Macintosh OSX

#### First Time Installing

1. Download the `.zip` file for this repo and move it to your `Desktop` (__this is important__)
   * To download, click on the green button above and then click `Download ZIP`
2. Extract the `.zip` file by `double clicking` it
3. Delete the `.zip` file as it is not needed anymore
4. Open up the extracted folder
5. Open the `SETUP.sh` file with the `Terminal`
   * Just search `Terminal.app` with spotlight (<kbd>Command</kbd>+<kbd>Space</kbd> &gt; `Terminal.app` &gt; <kbd>return</kbd>), and drag the `RUNME.sh` file onto the window and hit <kbd>return</kbd>
6. Follow the initial and ending prompts (you should eventually get 2 `Terminal` windows)

#### Any Time After First Time

1. Open the `RUN.sh` file with the `Terminal`
   * Open the `Terminal` by pressing <kbd>Command</kbd> and <kbd>Space</kbd> simultaneously and search `Terminal.app` and then hit <kbd>return</kbd>
   * Then just proceed to drag the `RUN.sh` file into the `Terminal` and press <kbd>return</kbd>
2. Follow the prompts

#### Uninstalling

1. Open the `UNINSTALLER.bash` file with the `Terminal`
   * Open the `Terminal` by pressing <kbd>Command</kbd> and <kbd>Space</kbd> simultaneously and search `Terminal.app` and then hit <kbd>return</kbd>
   * Then just proceed to drag the `UNINSTALLER.sh` file into the `Terminal` and press <kbd>return</kbd>
2. Follow the initial prompt

#### Updating 

1. Open the `UPDATER.bash` file with the `Terminal`
   * Open the `Terminal` by pressing <kbd>Command</kbd> and <kbd>Space</kbd> simultaneously and search `Terminal.app` and then hit <kbd>return</kbd>
   * Then just proceed to drag the `UNINSTALLER.sh` file into the `Terminal` and press <kbd>return</kbd>
  
### Troubleshooting

**If when you try to run the `RUNME.sh`, `RUNME_AFTER.sh`, `UPDATER.bash`, or `UNINSTALLER.bash` files; you get the error: `Permission Denied`, then follow these steps:**

1. Open the `Terminal`
   * Open the `Terminal` by pressing <kbd>Command</kbd> and <kbd>Space</kbd> simultaneously and search `Terminal.app` and then hit <kbd>return</kbd>
2. Type in `chmod +x ` (make sure to add the `space` after `+x`)
3. Then drag these files onto the terminal: `SETUP.sh`, `RUN.sh`, `UNINSTALLER.bash`, and `UPDATER.bash`
4. Press <kbd>return</kbd>
 
> **That should fix it ;)**

__For any other issues, please leave them in the issues tab so I can solve them ASAP. Thanks__

> Please note that anything in the `Terminal` that has the word `WARNING` (in caps or lower) next to it, or is in `yellow` color is not an error, so you won't have to worry about those things. Errors are *typically* `red` (*though not always*) and have the word `ERROR` (in caps or lower) next to them.
