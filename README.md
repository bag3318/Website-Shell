====================

Instructions
------------

### For Macintosh OSX

#### First Time Installing

1. Download the `.zip` file for this repo and move it to your `Desktop` (__this is important__)
   * To download, click on the green button above and then click `Download ZIP`
2. Extract the `.zip` file by `double clicking` it
3. Delete the `.zip` file as it is not needed anymore
4. Open up the extracted folder
5. Open the `RUNME.sh` file with the `Terminal`
   * Just search `Terminal` with spotlight (<kbd>Command</kbd>+<kbd>Space</kbd> &gt; `Terminal.app` &gt; <kbd>return</kbd>), and drag the `RUNME.sh` file onto the window and hit <kbd>return</kbd>
6. Follow the initial and ending prompts (you should eventually get 2 Terminal windows)

#### Second Time Running

1. Open the `RUNME_AFTER.sh` file with the `Terminal`
2. Follow the prompts

#### Uninstalling

1. Open the `UNINSTALLER.bash` file with the `Terminal`
2. Follow the initial prompt

### Troubleshooting

**If when you try to run the `RUNME.sh`, `RUNME_AFTER.sh`, or `UNINSTALLER.bash` files; you get the error: `Permission Denied`, then follow these steps:**

1. Open the `Terminal`
2. type in `chmod +x ` (make sure to add the `space` after `+x`
3. Then drag these files onto the terminal: `RUNME.sh`, `RUNME_AFTER.sh`, `UNINSTALLER.bash`
4. Press <kbd>return</kbd>
 
> **That should fix it ;)**
